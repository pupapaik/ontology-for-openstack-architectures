This paper covers configuration for various OpenStack architectures. OpenStack is the largest opensource cloud computing platform. It has gaining wide spread popularity among user as well as vendors. It is a very flexible system that can provision a wide range of virtualization scenarios.

In our work we propose a formalization of OpenStack architectural model that can be validated and served to configuration management tools as a node classifier. The OWL-DL based ontology components and their relations serve as foundation for further reasoning and medatada provision.
