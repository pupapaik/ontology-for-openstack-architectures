This paper explains how ontology can be used to model various OpenStack architectures. OpenStack is the largest open source cloud computing IaaS platform. It has been gaining wide spread popularity among users as well as software and hardware vendors over past few years. It's a very flexible system that can support a wide range of virtualization scenarios at any scale.

In our work we propose a formalization of OpenStack architectural model that can be automatically validated and serve suitable meta-data to configuration management tools. The OWL-DL based ontology defines service components and their relations and  provides foundation for further reasoning. Provided models can support simple all-in-one architecture as as well as large architectures with service components in High Availability setup.
