OpenStack is the largest opensource cloud computing platform. Many companies participate to its codebase and extend by writing new plugins and improving the core. The actual system consists of many components designed with plugin architecture to allow custom implementations for various backends. These components can be combined and configured to match available hardware resources and use case needs.

Each implementation has its own component setup and use configuration management tools like Foreman, Salt or Fuel to enforce the service states on designated resources. These tools require complete metadata set covering configuration of all compontents. Detecting component inconsistencies by hand is painful and time consuming process.

We propose a formalization of OpenStack architectural model, based on the approaches developed in classic knowledge representation domain. Component definition is encoded in an ontology using the standard OWL-DL language, which enables sharing of knowledge about configuration across various systems. Reasoning can be used on the specification to automate validation of configuration changes.

When dealing with hundreds of components, keeping track of changes throughout its life cycle is very challenging. Current approaches are ad hoc and proprietary, and there exists no standard for specifying common OpenStack architectural model. The question how to convert the proposed OWL-DL schema to metadata format that configuration management tools can process is discussed. We are working on external node classification service that uses graph database to serialize the OWL ontology with REST API that configuration management tools can use as metadata provider.
