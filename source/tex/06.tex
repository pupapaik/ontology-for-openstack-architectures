\section{Conclusion}

We have managed to do the first steps in formalization and real usage of IaaS high level models. The final representation of models, the ontologies, can now be used to create and validate meta-data for individual OpenStack cloud installations. The ontology provides schema for the meta-data for each installation so the overall integrity is ensured.

We created web a service that use the ontology to generate the suitable meta-data for configuration management tools. The service provide simple interface for manipulating the ontology as well as interfaces to other ontology editors. The ontology covers the basic services of OpenStack Havana version. It is possible to easily define new components and service backends.

% Ontologická reprezentace prostředí, která je vhodná pro agentové prostředí, aby bylo možné provádět autonomní rozhodnutí. 

\subsection{Future work}

We plan to expand mapping ontology from virtual and physical servers to network and storage resources by adopting configuration management tools. The service handling 

Ontology model is suitable for software agent processing and their rational decisions. It is possible to define agents that will maintain the state of services according to the high-level model.
