\section{Conclusion}

We have managed to do the first step to formalize and use IaaS Service Ontology to alleviate system operators tasks. The ontology can be used to create and validate meta-data for individual OpenStack installations. The generated meta-data is used to set-up variety of services from core, maintenance to actual OpenStack services. 

The ontology is  

Ontologická reprezentace prostředí, která je vhodná pro agentové prostředí, aby bylo možné provádět autonomní rozhodnutí. 

\subsection{Future work}

In the future we plan expand mapping ontology to network and storage resources in addition to servers with configuration tools. Ontology model is suitable for software agent processing and their rational decisions. It is possible to define processes that will maintain the configuration of real services in accordance to model systems.
