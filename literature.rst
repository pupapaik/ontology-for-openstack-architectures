  Configuration management is an important problem in large software systems. When dealing with hundreds of components, keeping track of version changes and various dependency constraints imposed on the system, throughout its development life cycle is very challenging. Current approaches are ad hoc and proprietary, and there exists no standard for specifying valid software configurations. We propose a novel formalization for configuration management, based on the approaches developed in classic knowledge representation domain. Component constraints and version restrictions are encoded in an ontology using the standard OWL-DL language (a W3C recommendation), which facilitates the sharing of knowledge about configurations, across various systems. Detection and pinpointing of component inconsistencies, by human, is a painstaking and time consuming process. The machine readability of the OWL language enables us to apply reasoning on the specification, and automatically deduce the validity of test configurations. In addition, justifications on the validity of a configuration are provided.

  Software Configuration Management (SCM) can be defined as the control of the evolution of complex software systems. It is a supporting software life cycle process that benefits several activities of the software process. SCM proved to be one of the most successful software engineering technologies, and there are many tools available to support it. In spite of that, SCM has some challenges to face. One of them is the limited capability of SCM tools to interoperate. In this paper, we present an evolution of a SCM Ontology that can be used as a reference model for understanding this domain and also to build an infrastructure to allow semantic interoperability between SCM tools and other software engineering tools. 1.
